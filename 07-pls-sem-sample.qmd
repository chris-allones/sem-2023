### Specifying the measurement model

```{r}
pls_mm_ebus <- 
  constructs(
  composite("tangible", multi_items("bt", c(1:2, 5:7))),
  composite("drivers_quality", multi_items("bd", 1:4)),
  composite("empathy", multi_items("emp", 1:5)),
  composite("env_perf", multi_items("ep", 1:4)),
  composite("customer_sat", multi_items("cs", 1:3)),
  composite("life_sat", multi_items("ls", 1:5))
)

plot(pls_mm_ebus)
```

### Specifying the structural model

```{r}
pls_sm_ebus <- 
  relationships(
  paths(from = c("tangible", "drivers_quality", "empathy", "env_perf"),
        to = "customer_sat"),
  paths(from = "customer_sat", to = "life_sat")
)

plot(pls_sm_ebus)
```

### Estimating PLS-SEM model

```{r}

pls_model_ebus <- 
  estimate_pls(
  data = case_data,
  measurement_model = pls_mm_ebus,
  structural_model = pls_sm_ebus
)


plot(pls_model_ebus)


summary_pls_model_ebus <- summary(pls_model_ebus)
summary_pls_model_ebus
```

### Bootstraping PLS-SEM

```{r}

## bootstrapping PLS-SEM model
boot_pls_model_ebus <- bootstrap_model(seminr_model = pls_model_ebus,
                nboot = 1000)

## summary results
summary_boot_pls_model_ebus <- summary(boot_pls_model_ebus, alpha = 0.10)
```

### Factor loadings

```{r}
# DT::datatable(summary_boot_pls_model_ebus$bootstrapped_loadings %>% round(3))
summary_boot_pls_model_ebus$bootstrapped_loadings
```

### Validity and reliability

Construct reliability or factor reliability assesses the extent to which a group of items is consistent in what it intends to measure. We want to test whether the items we selected are reliable or not.

-   Examples of reliability measurement are Cronbach's alpha, Rho A and Rho C. The three reliability measurement are similar to what they represent. Thus, the interpretation is the same.

-   Higher values indicate a higher level of reliability. Reliability values of 0.70 and above are satisfactory to a good measure of reliability.

-   Results show that all factors are above the recommended threshold of 0.70, indicating items used to measure the factors are reliable.

Convergent validity assesses how well the identified items as indicators for a construct measure the expected construct.

-   For example, emphaty was measured using 5 indicators, the construct validity can be used to determine how well those 5 indicators measure the factor of Job Satisfaction.

-   The Average Variance Extracted (AVE) is a measurement for convergent validity. An AVE greater than 0.50 provides evidence for convergent validity.

-   Results show that AVE for all factors is above the recommended threshold of 0.50, indicating the measured factors passed the convergent validity test.

### Discriminant validity

The discriminant validity assesses the extent to which a factor or construct is distinct from other constructs.

The idea is to identify unique items as measurements for an intended factor. If the selected items uniquely measure the intended factors, then that factor should not be highly correlated to other factors.

Fornell-Larcker criterion and the heterotrait-monotrait criterion are the most commonly used measurements for discriminant validity.

#### Fornell-Larcker Criterion

-   Italicized and bolded values are the factors. While non-bolded values are the inter-correlation of the factors.

-   To establish discriminant validity, the off-diagonal values should be less than AVE or the diagonal values (e.g., 0.853, 0.876, 0.855, ...).

-   Result shows that the factor's AVE is higher than the off-diagonal values.

```{r}
## Fornell-Larcker criterion results
summary_pls_model_ebus$validity$fl_criteria
```

#### Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio

-   To establish discriminant validity, the HTMT value should be lower than the recommended threshold of 0.90 or less than 0.85 for a more conservative threshold (Henseler et al., 2015)

-   When the HTMT value is high (above 0.90) it may suggest one or some indicators in one construct is highly related to another construct. It means the construct is not conceptually distinct.

-   Using the HTMT criterion, values are below 0.90 or 0.85, which suggests constructs passed the discriminant validity test.
